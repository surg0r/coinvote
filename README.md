Coin-weighted vote tracking

Work-in-progress

Proof-of-concept scripts which tracks specific message_tx in the QRL blockchain. Specific ID's may be supplied and the vote weighting of the emitted coin supply is displayed realtime by coinvote.py

Data of ongoing message_tx ID's is pickled into a file, to be parsed by coinvoteread.py.
